-👋 Hi, I’m @Isslemslema
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, IoT, and microcontroller-based projects. I love exploring how software interacts with the physical world through hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in embedded C programming, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and exploring various microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects involving embedded systems, especially those that push the boundaries of what these tiny but powerful devices can do.
